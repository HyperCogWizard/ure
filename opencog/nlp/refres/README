The core problem of reference resolution is determining when two words
in a text refer to the same concept. Thus, for example, the same noun,
used in neighboring sentences, probably refers to the same concept.
Alternately, anaphora (he, she, it, etc.) may also be used to refer to
the same concept.

This README file contains some working notes on how reference resolution
might be accomplished within the current OpenCog infrastructure. These
notes may at times be incoherent or disconnnected; this is a
work-in-progress.
