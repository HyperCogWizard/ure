The core problem of reference resolution is determining when two words
in a text refer to the same concept. Thus, for example, the same noun,
used in neighboring sentences, probably refers to the same concept.
Alternately, anaphora (he, she, it, etc.) may also be used to refer to
the same concept.

This README file contains some working notes on how reference resolution
might be accomplished within the current OpenCog infrastructure. These
notes may at times be incoherent or disconnnected; this is a
work-in-progress.

Overview
========
The current plan is to perform reference resolution using a collection
of "rules" or "proceedures" to recognize likely co-referents, and then
to check for reference consistency using reasoning. An example of a set
of rules is the "Hobbs algorithm" for anaphora resolution. 

The goal here is to implement all of these rules/algorithms as a set of 
OpenCog hypergraphs. The reason for doing this is to allow the system to
automatically learn, reinforce, and modify these sets of rules.  Thus,
for example, the Hobbs algo has been implemented in Java, as a part of 
the RelEx package. However, if changes are needed to this algorithm are
needed, then only a human programmer is capable of performing these
changes, as only a human programmer can (currently) understand Java and 
make meaningful modifications to Java code.  By contrast, the goal here
is to perform a statistical analysis of text, and to automatically
discover such rules, as best as possible, assign them likelyhoods and
weights that correspond to thier suitability in any given linguistic
situation.

There are then four practical considerations to aceiving the above
program:
1) Understanding how to represent "rules" as OpenCog hypergraphs
2) Having a "rule engine" that can apply these rules.
3) Having a persistent database that can accumulate statistical
   information about the usage of these rules,
4) Having a "perception" system that can spot rules ("features") 
   that have been useful, and further refine them, or spot weak
   rules, and reject them.

The fourth step seems to be the vaguest at this point. I hope to
combine ideas making use of mutual information, Markov networks and
Markov logic networks, and heirarchical feature selection to accomplish
this. The general idea is to be able to spot commonly-occuring patterns
or features, in much the same way that one might find patterns in
genetic data. 

It is expected that the system will be initially primed with a number
of hand-generated rules.

The first three issues are significant, practical barrirers to further
progress, and are thus tackled first.
