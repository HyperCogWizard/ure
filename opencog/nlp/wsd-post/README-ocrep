                         ------------------------------------

WordNet sense tags carry ontology relationships (is-a, part-of); thus,
tagging parsed sentences with WordNet sense tags is useful.  This README
reviews tagging markup and, in particular, the interpretation of the 
truth values.

There are two ways of obtaining weighted markup of words; one is via
the Mihalcea algo, the other is by lookup from syntax tables.  The 
code in the nlp/wsd directory generates the following linkages:


   
   InheritanceLink strength=0.0 confidence=0.01
      WordInstanceNode "bark_144"
      WordSenseNode "bark_sense_23"

then init to 1.0 0.9

the  set truth values
