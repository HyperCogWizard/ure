                   Language Learning
                   -----------------
             Linas Vepstas December 2013

Current project, under construction.

Steps:
1) Install the 'any' language for link-grammar
2) Set up and configure postgres, as described in 
   opencog/persist/sql/README
3) createdb learn-pairs
   cat atom.sql | psql learn-pairs
   Edit and setup ~/.odbc.ini
4) Start the cogserver

5) Copy the RelEx opencog-server.sh shell script to some other name.
   Edit it, and replace the final line with this:
   java $VM_OPTS $RELEX_OPTS $CLASSPATH relex.Server --lang any -n 999 --link --port 4444
   Run the new shell script.

   The above tells relex to use the 'any' language, and return up to 999
   different parses.

6) cat ./link-pipeline.scm |netcat localhost 17001

   Better idea: edit build/lib/opencog.conf and add nlp/learn/link-pipeline.scm
   to the list

7) telnet localhost 17001
   opencog> sql-open learn-pairs linas asdf
   opencog> scm
   guile> (observe-text "this is a test")

   Better yet:
   echo -e "scm\n (observe-text \"this is a another test\")" |nc localhost 17001
   echo -e "scm\n (observe-text \"Bernstein () (1876\")" |nc localhost 17001
   echo -e "scm\n (observe-text \"Lietuvos žydų kilmės žurnalistas\")" |nc localhost 17001

8) psql learn-pairs
   learn-pairs=# SELECT * from atoms;

9) She works!

That's all for now, folks!


TODO
----
* Handle database write asynchronously: have a thread collect
  up the atoms, and write them. Maybe even multiple threads.
  This is OK due to the atomptr design.
* Can we start a guile thread for each incoming sentence?
  Threading will require more subtle sentence cleanup.
* Table counts need to be more than 32-bit. Looks like the 
  any-language goes hog-wild and creates huge counts for just
  one sentence ... is this desired?  Anyway, they'll overflow...

DONE
----
* Make sure that link-parser fully randomizes linkage choices for
  long sentences. Done. See the rand_state and predictable_rand
  flags in version 4.8.3.
* Need a mutli-language sentence splitter; the maxent splitter only
  works for English sentences.  Probably something simple will do ...
  Done: copied one from moses-smt and put it into a relex subdirectory
* Raw psql seems not to be utf8.  Were the tables created wrong,
  or is this a client bug? 
  Fixed: turned out to be a guile-related bug.


Notes:
------
The relex parse is extreely fast, the cogserver part is extremely slow ... 
Non-linear, even.
4-word sentence: 53 parses, 3-4 seconds elapsed

5-word sentence, 373 parses,
32 second elapsed,
postgres runs at 36% cpu
cogserver runs at 56% cpu for a while then drops to 26% cpu

8-word sentence, max of 999 parses,
2 minutes elapsed.  Same CPU usage as above...


Wikipedia processing
--------------------
createdb fr_pairs lt_pairs pl_pairs simple_pairs
cat opencog/persist/sql/atom.sql | psql
vi .odbc.ini  learn-fr learn-lt learn-pl learn-simple

Sentence Splitting
------------------
Needs to be multi-language
NLTK
https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/tree/master/scripts/share/nonbreaking_prefixes
Has french, polish, latvian
its LGPL
Copy this over into relex, for now.

A question mark or exclamation mark always ends a sentence.  A period followed by an
upper-case letter generally ends a sentence, but there are a number of exceptions.  For
example, if the period is part of an abbreviated title ("Mr.", "Gen.", ...), it does not end a
sentence.  A period following a single capitalized letter is assumed to be a person's initial,
and is not considered the end of a sentence.
