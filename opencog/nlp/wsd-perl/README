  Miscellaneous scripts for processing word-sense disambiguation data.


The wsd directory contains an implementation of the Rada Mihalcea word-sense
disambiguation algorithm. The scm directory contains a set of scripts that
attach word senses to link-grammar parse disjuncts, and then update the 
corresponding scripts in SQL tables. SQL is used because it can take weeks
(or months) to accumulat a sufficient amount of statistics to be meaningul.
This directory contains code that implements the next steps in this processing
pipeline: script to compute marginal probabilities, obtained from the raw
counts stored in the SQL database.

The general analysis framework here is an outgrowth of the code that is found
in the 'lexical attraction' package, which is a distinct launchpad project.
In particular, the SQL table definitions are given there, not here. This
cross-project tie-in is a bit of a mess at the moment;  its not clear how
to best resolve it.
