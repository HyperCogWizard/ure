Consider the factual statement capital_of(France,Paris). This provides
an answer to the question capital_of(France, what) and simple pattern
matching is enough to supply the answer.  The only extra work we need to
do here is to validate that the second tripe is really a question. Tords
that end, we write the rule:

   IF $prep($var, $qvar) ^  # the question
      query_var($qvar) ^    # validate question
      $prep($var, $ans)     # answer
   THEN
      declare_answer($ans)

	   %InheritanceLink($qvar, DefinedLingRel "what") ^  # qvar is a query word
