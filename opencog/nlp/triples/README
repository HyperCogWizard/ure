                 Triples
                 -------

This directory contains some experimental code to extract conceptual 
entities and semantic triples from English text.  An example of a 
"conceptual entity" would be the "Great Southern Railroad": a business,
a railway, that existed at a certain point in space and time. A semantic
triple is a triple of subject-predicate-object, and is popularly the 
topic of "Semantic Web RDF" technology discussions[WP-RDF].  An example 
of a "semantic triple" is "the sky is blue". Written in prefix notation,
the triple is then "color_of(sky, blue)", with "color_of" beting the
protpery or predicate, while "sky" and "blue" are the subject and
object, respectively.

The primary challenges here are three-fold:
1) Dealing with the diversity of expression in the English language, 
   where most sentences are not short and to-the-point. For short,
   simple sentences, ReLex seems to provide enough normalization to
   extract at least some triples. But it is not clear how far this
   idea can be pushed.
2) Learning new relations. It is simple to code up, by hand, "framing"
   relationships, such as a list of colors, or a list properties that
   an object can have. It is harder to determine, when encountering a 
   new word, to determine that it is, for example, a color.
3) Constructing a data representation that is ameanable to reasoning,
   and to question answering.
