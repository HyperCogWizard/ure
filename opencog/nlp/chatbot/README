A quick-n-dirty hookup of the opencog internals to an IRC-based chatbot.

Currently, the bot is simply a protocol translator from the IRC protocol,
to opencog i/o. It is subject to change.

Configuring: 
-----------
There is an assortment of hard-coded configuration stuff in the source
code.  See go-irc.c for setable values for the name of the chatbot, the
irc channel and irc network to join, and the bot ID strings, etc.

By default, it connects to the #opencog channel on freenode.net.

The bot tries to connect to an opencog server at port 17004. This port 
number is hard-coded in whirr-sockets.cc.

Running:
--------
After modifying the hard-coded config as desired, start the bot by 
saying "opencog/nlp/chatbot/cogita". It should then appear on the IRC
channel. You can then talk to it by addressing it by name, i.e. 
prefacing comments with cog:, cogita: or cogita-bot:

To have it do something, you must have an opencog server running on
port 17004, and have the opencog server appropriately loaded up with
assorted databses, code, etc.

You also have to have the latest version of RelEx installed, and then
run ./opencog-server.sh from the main RelEx directory. This will create
a parse server on port 4444: it will read plain-text input, and generate
parsed text in opencog format.  The chatbot needs this server to process
text.

This is most easiloy done by starting the cogserver using the 
lib/opencog4.conf configuration file, which sets the correct port,
silences the opencog prompt, and loads the needed scheme files.
