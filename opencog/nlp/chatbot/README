A quick-n-dirty hookup of the opencog internals to an IRC-based chatbot.

Currently, the bot is simply a protocol translator from the IRC protocol,
to opencog i/o. It is subject to change.

Running:
After compiling, start the bot by saying "opencog/nlp/chatbot/cogita"

It will then join the #opencog channel on the IRC net freenode.net
