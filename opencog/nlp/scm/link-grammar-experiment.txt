Diary for experiments involving the learning of new link-grammar rules.

From email discussions:

It demonstrated a certain [ word from words.n.3]

to parse, then we would then allow bad parses for:
acetylene.n allspice.n antimony.n artillery.n

By squinting at the contents of words.n.3, it seems to
be partitionable into two categories: mass nouns that
name things (acetylene, etc.) and mass nouns that
name properties (e.g. allegiance.n aloofness.n)

Once one stares at link-grammar for a while, one
realizes that these kinds of problems are rife. They
would take a huge effort to fix, in piecemeal fashion.
This is why I am so interested in pursuing a statistical
approach: I want to gather a large database of actual
usage, counting the frequency of (disjunct, word-pair)
and then using these to spot groupings.

For example, (with your proposed fix), there should
be zero occurrances of a Ds link connecting "a" and
"acetylene".  On the other hand, we should see
Dmu links for "The acytlene exploded", but not for
"The adroitness exploded."

Notice that doing this leaks a bit of semantics into
the grammar: we would no longer be classing words
purely according to part-of-speech, but according to
finer divisions.
