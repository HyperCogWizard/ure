                  Assorted Scheme scripts
                  -----------------------

Currently, the primary focus of work in this directory is to update
a database of statistics based on running word-sense disambiguation
together with parse results. This is implemented in stats-collection.scm.

The actual SQL tables are defined and created by a different project 
(sorry!), the 'lexical attraction' package on launchpad.  See, in
particular, src/sql/disjunct.sql from that package.

OpenCog scripts
---------------
The following scripts are meant to run within the OpenCog scheme
interpreter (as they manipulate OpenCog atoms directly). They can be
manually loaded with the "load-nlp.sh" shell script, although they
normally would be automatically loaded with the opencog.conf file.

 * nlp-utils: Some mini nlp-related utilities, mostly for pointer 
   chasing nlp-specific structures.

 * stats-collection.scm: Look for documents for which word-sense
   disambiguation has been performed; use these to update a database
   of statistics that associates link-grammar parses with wsd results.

 * parse-rank.scm: Tweak link-grammar parse-ranking scores, based
   on the mutual information contained in word pairs. (Not currently
   used)

 * disjunct-list.scm: Build lists of link-grammar disjuncts.

 * wsd-process.scm: top-level script for driving WSD processing. 
   It takes input files, loads them into opencog, performs the WSD,
   stores the accumulated statistics, and then moves each input file
   out of the way, to denote that its done with that file.  Explicit
   paths to data files need to be provided.
