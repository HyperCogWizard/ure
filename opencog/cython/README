Python bindings for OpenCog, the General Artificial Inteligence (GAI)
research framework. http://opencog.org/
==============

Written by Joel Pitt <joel@opencog.org>

WARNING: In Development and the API is liable to change.

Requirements:
 - Cython 0.14 or later.
 - Python 2.6 or later - these bindings may work with earlier version, but
   they have not been tested at all.

The below details might be useful for working locally and hacking around
with the bindings, but these bindings should be close to building correctly
with CMake now. Thus all you need to use is "make opencogcy" from the build
directory.

---
To generate with cython:

$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

To test bindings (in OSX) with nosetests:

$ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/path/to/libatomspace.dylib/ nosetests -s
