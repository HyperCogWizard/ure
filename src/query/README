                    query
                    -----

Simple, experimental implementation of query processing
pre-prototype, broken, doesn't do anything yet.

Conceptual problems, design problems:
-------------------------------------
-- How to distinguish rhetorical questions from queries that should
   be answered?  A block of input text may contain rhetorical questions,
   which should be ignored.

-- How should query processing be triggered?  What channel should be 
   used for reply? Currently, all input to CogServer is via XML, which 
   is parsed. If the parse is successful, no further processing is done. 

   Query processing could be performed by a mind agent, but how should
   its activity be triggered, and what communictations channel should
   it use to post a reply?


Diary and Notes
---------------
Use special token to trigger mind agent. Per Ben, "DialogManager",
there are for such tokens:
-- query
-- statement
-- command
-- interjection

Right now, all four of these will be surrounded by an AssertionLink.
The query processor will look for  these, perform some basic sentence
analysis, and dispose of these as appropriate (i.e. generating an
appropriate reply).

Hmmm .. queries need to be morphed into predicates !? 
i.e. use a PredicateNode, and an EvalLink
