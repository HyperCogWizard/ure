This directory contains a miscellany of natural language processing
tools (for the English language). Current focus is on word sense
disambiguation.

The wordnet-import directory contains stand-alone code (i.e. not a part
of opencog) that will walk over the wordnet database, and convert it 
into OpenCog NMXML that can be leaded into opencog.

The wsd directory contains code that implements the Rada Mihalcea 
word-sense disambiguation algorithm.




A classic parse-ranking example:
(S (NP I) (VP saw (NP the man) (PP with (NP the telescope))) .)

(S (NP I) (VP saw (NP (NP the man) (PP with (NP the telescope)))) .)
