Import the wordnet synsets into opencog.  Uses the NLTK wordnet python
libraries to do so.  Because the NLTK wordnet code is under the GPLv2
license, then so is the code in this directory. The GPLv2 applies to 
code in this directory only.

The prototype has barely been started, nothing works yet.

To run: at the command line, "python import.py"
Must have wordnet, python 2.5 and NLTK installed.

Proposed Mapping
