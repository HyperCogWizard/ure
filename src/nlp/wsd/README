Associated with every word is a list of possible senses.
Thus:
    <WordNode name="bark">   -- a word.

A "word sense" is a bag of information about a single semantic
sense of a word. This bag includes information about the part-of-speech
(noun, verb, etc.), example usages, pointers to synonym sets (synsets),
hyponyms, hypernyms, etc. Thus, a "word sense" is an unordered link.

In the opencog type heirarchy,
   WORD_SENSE_LINK <- SET_LINK


The possible senses are group according to rough part-of-speech
categories: noun, verb, adjective adverb.
