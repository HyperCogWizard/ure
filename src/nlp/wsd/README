Associated with every word is a list of possible senses.
Consider the word "bark", thus:

    <WordNode name="bark">   -- a word.

A "word sense" is a bag of information about a single semantic
sense of a word. This bag includes information about the part-of-speech
(noun, verb, etc.), example usages, pointers to synonym sets (synsets),
hyponyms, hypernyms, etc. Thus, a "word sense" is an unordered link.

In the opencog type heirarchy, (type.script)
   WORD_SENSE_LINK <- SET_LINK

A WordSenseLink will, of course, include the word itself:

   <WordSenseLink>
      <WordNode name="bark">
   </WordSenseLink>

Word senses can be crudely categorized according to part-of-speech.
Thus:
   PART_OF_SPEECH_NODE <- NODE

and

   <WordSenseLink>
      <WordNode name="bark">
      <PartOfSpeechNode name="noun">
   </WordSenseLink>

Each of these nodes and links are assigned a truth value of 1 and a
confidence of 1. Non-unit truthvalues & confidence will be used when 
relating word senses to the use of actual words in sentences. Here, 
however, the goal is to state "this word might have this meaning, no 
matter how rarely used this meaing might be."

Word senses are commonly established by giving sister terms (loose 
synonyms), as well as hypernyms, hyponyms, part holonyms, etc. A 
synonym/hypernym/hyponym/etc. are thus links. Since some sister
terms are closer than others, these links will have non-unit truth
values. Thus:

   HYPERNYM_LINK <- CONCEPT_LINK
   HYPONYM_LINK <- CONCEPT_LINK

   <WordSenseLink>
      <WordNode name="bark">
      <PartOfSpeechNode name="noun">
      <HypernymLink strength=0.8 confidence=0.9>
         <WordSenseLink>
            <WordNode name="covering">
         </WordSenseLink>
      </HypernymLink>
      <HyponymLink strength=0.8 confidence=0.9>
         <WordSenseLink>
            <WordNode name="cork">
         </WordSenseLink>
      </HyponymLink>
   </WordSenseLink>

Indicates that "bark" is a kind of "covering", and that "cork" is a 
kind of bark. Note that the hyper/hypo links link not to word nodes,
but to other word-sense links.  There may be many hypo/hyper links
in a word sense.

There is a potential confusion as to the idea of a "synonym", as 
some synonyms are better than others. In an attempt to avoid this
confusion, and stay close to the wordnet idea of a "sister term", 
these will be called Sisnym's. The idea of a synonym will be reserved
for relations between words, rather than relations between concepts.

Thus:

   SISNYM_LINK <- CONCEPT_LINK
 
Wordnet uses the idea of "part holonyms", which is mirrored here.
Thus:

   HOLONYM_LINK <- CONCEPT_LINK
   MERONYM_LINK <- CONCEPT_LINK

To continue with the tree-bark example:

   <WordSenseLink>
      <WordNode name="bark">
      <PartOfSpeechNode name="noun">
      <HypernymLink strength=0.8 confidence=0.9>
         <WordSenseLink>
            <WordNode name="covering">
         </WordSenseLink>
      </HypernymLink>
      <HyponymLink strength=0.8 confidence=0.9>
         <WordSenseLink>
            <WordNode name="cork">
         </WordSenseLink>
      </HyponymLink>
   </WordSenseLink>
