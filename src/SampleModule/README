An example of how to make a module that is loadable into the CogServer with
the dlopen command. e.g.,

../CogServer/cogServer &
[2008-05-28 11:32:18:118] [INFO] opencog server ready.
telnet localhost 17001
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
opencog> dlopen libSampleModule.so
hello world
ok
