This directory contains an experimental, rather broken binding to
the scheme programming language, via guile. Scheme is a lisp dialect.
This binding is intended to be used for day-to-day maintenance 
activities, and for experimentation. it is not meant to be used 
for any sort of serious calculation, simply because it is not
(and cannot be) a high-performance interface. Guile is an interpreter,
not a compiler, and so will never have the performance of compiled code.


Functions:

   cog-atom handle   -- reference the atom identified by the numeric handle
       Example: (cog-atom 4444) prints the atom associated with handle 4444.
