                  AIML in the AtomSpace
                  ---------------------

Under development, very incomplete.

Goal: map AIML expressions to equivalent atomspace graphs, in stuch a
way that the OpenCog pattern matcher can perform all of the same
funcitons that AIML currently performs.

Examples:

        Input               that     topic     result
(R1) Hello                    *       *        Hi there
(R2) Hi                       *       *        <srai>Hello</srai>
(R3) I * you                  *       *        I <star/> you too.
(R4) What time is it          *       *        The time is <syscall>
(R5) *                        *       *        I don't get it.
